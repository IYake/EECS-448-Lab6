Functions that don't work:
  - isEmpty()
  - removeFront()
  - removeBack()
  - addFront()
  - addBack()

Best Guesses as to what the bugs are:
  - isEmpty() always returns true
  - removeFront() doesn't change the list
  - removeBack() doesn't change the list
  - addFront() adds to the back
  - addBack() adds to the front
